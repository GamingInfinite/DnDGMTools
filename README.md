# DnDGMTools
This is a set of tools for DM's to easily manage the health and stats of all the players in the campaign.  This is meant to be a very simple way to keep track of all of the things that a DM needs to keep track of, as well as roll dice automatically so that the story moves fluidly as if it were being told and already happened.
