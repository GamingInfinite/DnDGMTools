# DnDGMTools
This is a set of tools for DM's to easily manage the health and stats of all the players in the campaign, all built in Java.  This is meant to be a very simple way to keep track of all of the things that a DM needs to keep track of, as well as roll dice automatically so that the story moves fluidly as if it were being told and already happened.  This version is made purely text-based.

## Features

### On Open
This is the men
* Create - Creates an entirely new campaign where it will ask you how many characters as well as what their names are and their stats.  In the main menu, you are able to assign the rest of the attributes of the character.

* Load - Allows you to load a saved file from this program.

### Main Menu

* selectrace - This command creates a prompt for you to choose a character, and choose the race for that character.  This does **NOT** apply racial bonuses, at least for this version of the tools.

* selectclass - This command creates a prompt for you to choose a character, and choose the race for that character.  This version of the tools does not implement any sort of spell list or spell slot tracking system
